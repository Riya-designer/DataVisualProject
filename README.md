## 🧹 Data Cleaning & Preprocessing

Key data preparation steps included:

* Converting rating values from text format (e.g., `4.2/5`) into numeric values
* Checking and validating missing or inconsistent data
* Preparing clean columns for exploratory data analysis

---

## 📊 Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

The following analyses were performed:

* Distribution of restaurant types
* Customer engagement analysis using votes
* Comparison of online vs offline ordering behavior
* Rating analysis across different restaurant categories

Visualizations were created to support **data-driven storytelling** and make insights easy to interpret.

## 🔍 Key Insights

* Dining restaurants dominate the platform, indicating a strong preference for dine-in experiences
* Cafes show a higher preference for online ordering compared to other restaurant types
* Customer engagement (votes) varies significantly across restaurant categories
* Ordering behavior differs based on the type of restaurant and service offered

---

## 💡 Business Recommendations

* Dining restaurants should focus on enhancing in-store customer experience
* Cafes and quick-service outlets can benefit from investing more in online delivery platforms
* Restaurants can improve visibility by aligning services with customer preferences
* Food platforms can use these insights to improve recommendations and listings
